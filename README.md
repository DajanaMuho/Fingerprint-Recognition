FINGERPRINT CLASSIFICATION & IDENTIFICATION

IMAGE GATHERING:

Fingerprint images in PNG format with associated text file containing Gender, Class, and History for each image.
Dataset sourced from Cainvas Dataset.
IMAGE PREPROCESSING:

Implemented two pipelines for image preprocessing: Inpainting and Denoise Filters, Sharpening, and Enhancement with Gamma Correction.
Utilized Normalization, Segmentation, Enhancement, Binarization, and Skeletonization techniques to improve image quality.
Utilized FFT to enhance images in the second pipeline.
FEATURE EXTRACTION:

Utilized Histogram Features (Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Entropy), HOG Features, Color Features (R, G, B), and SIFT for feature extraction.
CLASSIFICATION:

Utilized SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression algorithms for fingerprint classification.
IMAGE MATCHING:

Performed performance evaluation and decision making for image matching.
Note: This project involved the implementation of various techniques and algorithms for image processing, feature extraction, classification, and matching, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability of fingerprint identification.
